# My Professional Website

## What it is now

A copy of my resume in HTML5 and CSS3. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn web development, so I'm starting with the basics as I figure out both the code part and what my personal brand is.

## What I hope to make it

Short-term goal: responsive and mobile-friendly

Long-term goal: engaging content, i.e., a site which not only presents information, but enhances its meaning via presentation

Lofty goal: A reflection of me and of the work I am capable of
